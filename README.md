# PHP-Project
This is my PHP project which is a Blog website where a person can register an account and view the blogs.
I have also made a video which is in the zip file explaing a little about my project.
Inside the main folder, there is admin, includes ans static folder which is made so that the files don't get mixed up. The blog has an admin area as well as public area. In the admin area, there are two types : Admin and Author.

Admin has the power to create, view, update, publish/unpublish and delete blog as well as topics. Admin user also can create another admin user or author. Admin can also view, update and delete other admin and author users.

Author has less functions as they can only create, view, update and delete only posts created by themselves and cannot publish any post/blog.

For public area:
Only published posts are shown in the public area for viewing.
Each post is under a particular topic.
The public page lists posts; each post displayed with a featured image, author, and date of creation.
The user can view through all posts under a particular topic by clicking on the topic.
When a user clicks on a post, they can view the full post. 

Inside the main folder:
there is admin which holds files for the admin backend area which helps with creating, viewing, updating and deleting posts, topics, users.
2nd one is includes which holds files containing code that will be included/connected into one or more other pages. E.g. filoes for header and footer
the last one is static which keeps files such as images, CSS stylesheets used for making the website pretty.

There is index.php which is the main file where all the files are connected to it. It is like the face of the website.
That's it explaining a little about my project and please don't forget to watch the video named 'watch me.mp4' where I have further explained on the website. 

I took some help from the internet and it really helped to solve my problems. I had to take the help of Chat Gpt for the logout as I couldn't solve the problem which it solved so easily.
Also, I forgot to mention a txt file where there is the username and password for logging in the author and admin. I forgot to add the id and password for users in public area but it can be done by registering.
I think that is all.
Thank you and I hope you have a wonderful morning/day/night.
